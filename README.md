#  Assignment 3- RNNs & LSTMs

> Submitted by Nikhil Shrimali

## Target
* Refer to the file we wrote in the [class](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-xwX32O0WYOqcCROJnnJiSdzScPCudAM?usp=sharing) (Links to an external site.): Rewrite this code, but this time remove RNN and add LSTM.  
* Refer to this [file](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12Pciev6dvYBJ7KxwSHruG-XMwcoj0SfJ). 

  * The questions this time are already mentioned in the file. Take as much time as you want (but less than 7 days), to solve the file. Once you are done, then write your solutions in the quiz. 
  * Please note that the Session 4 Assignment Solution will time out after 15 minutes, as you just have to copy-paste your answers. 

## Solution
* RNN code rewritten for LSTM can be found [here](https://github.com/nikshrimali/TSAI_END2_Phase1/blob/Assignment4-RNN-LSTM/RNN_and_LSTM.ipynb)
* Quiz Solution can be found [here](https://github.com/nikshrimali/TSAI_END2_Phase1/blob/Assignment4-RNN-LSTM/S4Q4.ipynb)

## Future Aspirations
* I need to dig more about LSTMs, to understand where and how transformers are really excelling over these once sota models.
