# Assignment 9 - Learning rates and Evaluation Metrics
> Submitted by Nikhil Shrimali

## Target
* Pick any of your past code and:
    * Implement the following metrics (either on separate models or same, your choice):
        * Recall, Precision, and F1 Score
        BLEU 
        * Perplexity (explain whether you are using bigram, trigram, or something else, what does your PPL score represent?)
        * BERTScore (here are [1](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1kpL8Y_AnUUiCxFjhxSrxCsc6-sDMNb_Q), [2](https://huggingface.co/metrics/bertscore)  examples)
    * Once done, proceed to answer questions in the Assignment-Submission Page. Questions asked are:
        * Share the link to the readme file where you have explained all 4 metrics. 
        * Share the link(s) where we can find the code and training logs for all of your 4 metrics
        * Share the last 2-3 epochs/stage logs for all of your 4 metrics separately (A, B, C, D) and describe your understanding about the numbers you're seeing, are they good/bad? Why?
