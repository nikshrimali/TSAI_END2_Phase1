# Assignment 7 - Seq2Seq
> Submitted by Nikhil Shrimali

## Target
* Assignment 1 (500 points):
    * Submit the Assignment 5 as Assignment 1. To be clear,
        * ONLY use datasetSentences.txt. (no augmentation required)
        * Your dataset must have around 12k examples.
        * Split Dataset into 70/30 Train and Test (no validation)
        * Convert floating-point labels into 5 classes (0-0.2, 0.2-0.4, 0.4-0.6, 0.6-0.8, 0.8-1.0) 
        * Upload to github and proceed to answer these questions asked in the S7 - Assignment Solutions, where these questions are asked:
            * Share the link to your github repo (100 pts for code quality/file structure/model accuracy)
            * Share the link to your readme file (200 points for proper readme file)
            * Copy-paste the code related to your dataset preparation (100 pts)
            * Share your training log text (you MUST have been testing for test accuracy after every epoch) (200 pts)
            * Share the prediction on 10 samples picked from the test dataset. (100 pts)
* Assignment 2 (300 points):
    * Train model we wrote in the class on the following two datasets taken from this [link](https://kili-technology.com/blog/chatbot-training-datasets/): 
        * [CMU Dataset](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/QA-data/)
        * [Quora Question Pairs Dataset](https://quoradata.quora.com/First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs)
    * Once done, please upload the file to github and proceed to answer these questions in the S7 - Assignment Solutions, where these questions are asked:
        * Share the link to your github repo (100 pts for code quality/file structure/model accuracy) (100 pts)
        * Share the link to your readme file (100 points for proper readme file), this file can be the second part of your Part 1 Readme (basically you can have only 1 Readme, describing both assignments if you want) (100 pts)
        * Copy-paste the code related to your dataset preparation for both datasets.  (100 pts)
