# Assignment 2 - Back Propagation

> Submitted by Naman Shrimali

## Target
Rewrite the whole excel sheet showing backpropagation. Explain each major step, and write it on Github. 
* Use exactly the same values for all variables as used in the class
* Take a screenshot, and show that screenshot in the readme file
* Excel file must be there for us to cross-check the image shown on readme (no image = no score)
* Explain each major step
* Show what happens to the error graph when you change the learning rate from [0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0] 

## Mini Neural Network

<center>This is our mini model !</center>

### Key Features
It's a mini neural network, which
* Takes 2 inputs
* Has a total of 8 weights
* Does not have any biases 
* Uses ReLU as the activation function
* Uses Gradiant descent algorithm for updating weights
* Uses _L2_ Loss

## Results
The excel sheet uploaded in the repository contains in-depth calculations for learning rates 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 2.0.
